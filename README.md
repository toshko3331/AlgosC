# Sorting Algorithms Implemented in C

This project aims to measure the efficiency between my own implementation and standard implementation of common algorithms. The source for the standard implementation of each algorithm is still undetermined, however it will most likely come from some sort of standard library for windows.

Algorithms to be Implemented
------
* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort
* Counting Sort
* Radix Sort
* Bucket Sort
